#### Problem #1

###### Using Twitter Bootstrap (any version), make a single page with static HTML that includes:
Input form for a new todo item  
Table with rows for each todo item

###### Each todo item contains the following data elements:
Name (string)  
Topic (Array of strings)  
Due Date (date)  
Completed (boolean)  

Fill in the HTML with 5 example todo items.

Please take creative liberties with styling HTML to be something that youâ€™d be happy using :)

#### Notes
At Turing we wrote our own CSS/SASS so it was interesting to try and customize the Bootstrap classes and styles with my own CSS. I felt like I was beginning to understand what bootstrap gave me built-in but I definitely want to play with it more to understand what I am getting under the hood with these class names.
