#### Problem #1

###### Using Twitter Bootstrap (any version), make a single page with static HTML that includes:
Input form for a new todo item  
Table with rows for each todo item

###### Each todo item contains the following data elements:
Name (string)  
Topic (Array of strings)  
Due Date (date)  
Completed (boolean)  

Fill in the HTML with 5 example todo items.

Please take creative liberties with styling HTML to be something that youâ€™d be happy using :)
